# Matrix Multiplication on GPU
This project demonstrates the implementation of matrix multiplication on a GPU using CUDA. Building on previous work done on CPU, we will explore various techniques to optimize matrix multiplication by leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.


## Overview

In this project, we implement the multiplication of two matrices on a GPU. We will start with a basic kernel implementation and progressively enhance it to handle larger matrices efficiently.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- CUDA Toolkit (version X.X)
- A CUDA-capable GPU
- C/C++ Compiler (GCC/Clang for Linux, MSVC for Windows)

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrix-multiplication-gpu.git
```
these codes have been tested in google colab
